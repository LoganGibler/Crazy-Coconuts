                                    OPTIONS
                
python3 ./Ptool.py [options]

       --c              :   Checks inputed password, returns a letter grade and suggestions to
                            improve password.

       --g              :   Generates brand new password, length always 10-16 characters, 
                            variety of lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers, and 
                            special allowed special characters.

       --gc             :   Performs same function as [--g] option, yet returns a letter
                            grade and provides suggestions to improve generated password. 

       --cp             :   Compares <inputedpassword> against a large list of compromised
                            passwords, returns status if the <inputedpassword> is leaked.

       --ch             :   Use this option if you need to crack a md5 hashed password, after typing 
                            --ch, simply input the hashed password. By default, this option will use
                            the rockyou.txt wordlist to crack your inputed hash.
                            URGENT: If you wish to use this, you need to make a clean copy of rockyou.txt,
                            as it has characters that cannot be encoded. Please paste this command-
                            iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt > ~/rockyou_clean.txt.  

       --tc             :   Gives a time estimate on how long it would take to crack the inputed password.
